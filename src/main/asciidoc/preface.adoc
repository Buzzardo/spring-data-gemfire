= Preface

_Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_ focuses on integrating the _Spring Framework's_ powerful, non-invasive programming model
and concepts with Pivotal GemFire to simplify configuration and development of Java applications using Pivotal GemFire.

This document assumes the reader already has a basic understanding and some familiarity with the core _Spring Framework_
and Pivotal GemFire concepts and APIs.

While every effort has been made to ensure this documentation is comprehensive and complete without errors,
some topics are beyond the scope of this document and may require more explanation (e.g. data distribution management
using partitioning with HA while still preserving consistency).  Additionally, some typos might have crept in.
If you do spot mistakes or even more serious errors and you can spare a few cycles, please do bring these issues
to the attention of the _Spring Data_ team by raising an appropriate
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SGF[issue in JIRA].

Thank you.
